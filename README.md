# A-Noise-Robust-Approach-Using-Dynamic-Graph-Neural-Networks-for-Bus-Passenger-Flow-Prediction
the code for time serious prediction 

1. we use find_true to find true value to prediction
2. we use GMM to filter the data after KNN to deal reduce the noise
3. we use DGCN to capture the feture of graph construction. in this sdction, including feature expansion and feature fusion.
4. finallt we use LNN model to predict and compare with CNN LSTM GRU and we use MSE RMSE and percent accuracy to evaluate the model.
5. The original data is too big. It can't be share in github. I will be pleasure to share with you. Please fell free to email : x_z93517@live.concordia.ca the processing data i wll share after the paper is accepted. Thanks for your time and Star.
